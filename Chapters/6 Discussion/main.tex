Discussion of results (justification phase): The critical discussion of the technical or analytical work steps is
presented here and the relevance to innovation is established. Comparisons with other results on similar
questions in the literature are entirely appropriate (reference to questions and knowledge gaps in existing literature on the topic identified in the “Related Work” chapter). Arguments may also be presented here concerning
social relevance and responsibility with regard to the research question, or it may be placed it in the
context of an overall social discourse.
