Value  according to pierce steel  defines the importance of something to an individual or the amount of effort
 an individual is willing to spend to acquire something.
Every task has a value and a task is aversive if the value is lower than the effort needed to complete it.
The value of a task could be the enjoyment of the task itself or the value of the outcome of the task.
The value of a task can change over time and can be influenced by external factors such as changing economic conditions or technological advances.
the value of a task can also be influenced by the individual's perception of the task.
Value can also be measured by the amount of effort an individual is willing to spend to acquire something.
A person may be willing to invest more money or time into obtaining an item if it is perceived as being highly valuable,
but may not be as motivated for an item that has less value.
Thus, different people can assign different levels of value to the same thing depending on their own preferences and beliefs.
Ultimately, value is a subjective concept that is determined by individual perception.\cite{Steel2007}
