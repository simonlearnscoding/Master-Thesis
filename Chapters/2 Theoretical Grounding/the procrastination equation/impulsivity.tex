According to the american association of psychology, impulsivity is "
describing or displaying behavior characterized by little or no forethought,
reflection, or consideration of the consequences of an action,
particularly one that involves taking risks. [p. 470]\cite{APA2022}

Steel note that Both lethargy and impulsiveness are expected to predict procrastination.
Lethargy typically indicates a lack of extraversion and an overall unwillingness to take on
new tasks or engage in
social situations, while impulsiveness typically suggests an abundance of energy and excitement
towards accomplishing tasks. An individual exhibiting both traits can prove difficult to motivate,
leading to procrastination.\cite{Steel2007}

Blatt and Quinlan suggest that impulsive people often find themselves pulled in many
directions based on the desires of the present moment. This way impulsive individuals often
become distracted by tasks or ideas that do not have any relevance to their original long-term goal.
Additionally, impulsive people may have difficulty managing time,
as they tend to focus on whatever task or idea they are drawn to the present moment,
instead of what needs to be done.\cite{Blatt1967Apr}


Given that future considerations do not significantly influence their judgments,
they frequently pursue
momentary satisfaction, ignoring or avoiding longer-term responsibilities
sibilities.
As a result, impulsivity is comparable to the construct
of a present-oriented nature.\cite{Steel2007}
