Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, author of Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, discussed the idea of productivity in terms of having a sense of control over one's work and the ability to engage in it fully. According to Csikszentmihalyi, productivity is not about working hard or long hours, but rather about achieving a state of flow in which you are completely absorbed in your work.
