John Perry coined the term "structured procrastination"

Procrastination can also lead to a type of productivity known as structured procrastination.
Structured procrastination occurs when people delay tasks,
but only those that they do not enjoy or that are not important.
They then use the time they save from procrastinating on these tasks to work on tasks that they
enjoy or that are important. This type of procrastination can actually lead to higher levels of productivity,
because people are able to focus on the tasks that are most important to them.
